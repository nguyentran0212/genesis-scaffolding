# Routers

## Overview

The FastAPI server uses a modular router structure. Each router handles a distinct domain and is mounted at a prefix. Authentication is enforced per-router via dependency injection.

## Router Map

| Router | Prefix | Responsibility |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| `agents` | `/api/agents` | Agent CRUD, agent registry |
| `auth` | `/auth` | Login, token refresh, logout |
| `chat` | `/api/chats` | Chat sessions, SSE streaming |
| `files` | `/api/files` | File upload/download, workspace files |
| `jobs` | `/api/jobs` | Workflow job status and logs |
| `llm_config` | `/api/llm-config` | LLM provider and model configuration |
| `memory` | `/api/memory` | Agent memory operations |
| `productivity` | `/api/productivity` | Tasks, projects, journals CRUD |
| `schedules` | `/api/schedules` | Cron schedule management |
| `users` | `/api/users` | User account management |
| `workflows` | `/api/workflows` | Workflow manifest management |

## Dependency Injection

The `dependencies.py` module provides shared dependency functions used across routers:

| Dependency | Type | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| `get_current_user` | `User` | Decodes JWT, returns the authenticated user |
| `get_current_active_user` | `User` | Checks user is not disabled |
| `get_user_config` | `Config` | Builds per-user config from user-level YAML override |
| `get_user_workdir` | `Path` | Returns the user's sandboxed working directory |
| `get_productivity_session` | `Session` | Opens the user's productivity SQLite database |
| `get_agent_registry` | `AgentRegistry` | User-scoped agent registry |
| `get_workflow_registry` | `WorkflowRegistry` | User-scoped workflow registry |
| `get_workspace_manager` | `WorkspaceManager` | User's workspace manager |
| `get_workflow_engine` | `WorkflowEngine` | Configured workflow engine |
| `get_memory_session` | `Session` | Opens the user's memory SQLite database |
| `get_scheduler_manager` | `SchedulerManager` | System-wide scheduler (from app state) |

The dependency chain ensures user isolation at every layer: `get_current_user` → `get_user_config` → all user-scoped services.

## User Isolation

Each authenticated request is scoped to the calling user through a cascading dependency chain. `get_current_user` decodes the JWT subject claim and retrieves the user record. That user flows into `get_user_workdir`, which resolves the user's sandboxed directory path. From there, `get_user_config` merges the user's YAML override into the base config, giving each service its own isolated view of per-user databases and file paths.
