## Overview

These guides cover the processes and conventions for extending and maintaining the Genesis Scaffolding application.

## Guide Index

### Adapting the Scaffolding

- [Decision Process](adaptation/decision-process.md) — How to select the right extensions and plan the adaptation
- [Principles](adaptation/principles.md) — Core principles to follow when modifying the scaffold
- [Playbooks](adaptation/) — Step-by-step checklists for each app type:
  - [Core Web App](adaptation/core-web-app.md) — Web UI only, no agents/workflows/productivity
  - [Productivity App](adaptation/playbooks/productivity-app.md) — Base + tasks, projects, journals
  - [Workflow App](adaptation/playbooks/workflow-app.md) — Base + automated processes, scheduling
  - [Full Agent App](adaptation/playbooks/full-agent-app.md) — Everything enabled

### Extending the Frontend

- [Frontend Pages](extending-the-frontend/frontend-pages.md) — Layout, sizing, scroll management, and page archetypes
- [Frontend Tables](extending-the-frontend/frontend-tables.md) — Data table patterns with TanStack Table

### Using Workflows

- [Workflow Guide](using-workflows/workflow-guide.md) — Writing YAML workflow manifests, invoking workflows programmatically
- [Scheduled Workflows](using-workflows/scheduled-workflows.md) — Creating cron-based workflow schedules

### Maintaining

- [Testing](maintaining/testing.md) — Testing conventions and patterns
- [Documentation](maintaining/documentation.md) — How to write and maintain documentation

## Tooling

### Python Side

Always use `uv run python` (not bare `python`) when running Python scripts or commands. The project uses `uv` for package management and virtual environment handling — calling `python` directly may miss dependencies or use the wrong environment.

```bash
# Correct
uv run python scripts/some_script.py

# Avoid
python scripts/some_script.py
```

### Frontend Side

Always use `pnpm` for anything related to the Node.js/frontend side. The project does not set up `npm` directly — `pnpm` is the installed package manager.

```bash
# Correct
pnpm install
pnpm dev

# Avoid
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Tool Summary

| Area | Tool | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Python runtime | `uv run python` | Not bare `python` |
| Python packages | `uv` | uv handles venv and lock file |
| Frontend packages | `pnpm` | Not `npm` |
| Frontend dev | `pnpm dev` / `pnpm build` | Next.js via pnpm |
| Linting/Type | pyright, ruff, eslint | Configured per package |
